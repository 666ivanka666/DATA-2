Network and structured data processing
We refer to a network as a group of interconnected devices communicating with each other.

Data processing

refers to the use of software to manipulate, analyze and transform data
involve a range of activities, including data input, storage, retrieval, analysis, visualization...
Structured data: organized in a specific (mostly predefined) format, making it easy to search, sort, analyze etc.

tabular data in a spreadsheet or CSV file
hierarchically organized data in JSON file
rows in a database table
Unstructured data: does not have a predefined structure and cannot be easily organized or analyzed using "traditional" data processing tools. Examples: emails, social media posts, images, audio and video files, and documents with no clear formatting or organization. In a sense, here we also mention semi-structured data that has some structure, less than fully structured data and more than unstructured. Examples are HTML documents.
